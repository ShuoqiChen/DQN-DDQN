** What is, and why  Q Learning?**


Q-learning is an off policy reinforcement learning algorithm. It is off-policy RL because the q-learning function learns from actions that are not the most updated policy. Essentially, q-learning seeks to learn a policy that maximizes the total reward.

Q learning is useful when we seeks to find the best action to take given the current state. In Q-learning related algorithms, an agent tries to learn the optimal policy from its history of interaction with the environment. It's an intuitive an elegant solutions to many RL problems.
